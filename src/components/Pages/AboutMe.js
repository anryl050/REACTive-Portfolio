                <p className="" style={styles.p}> My journey began in a small southwestern town in the former Soviet Union. At a young age, my family made the decision to immigrate to the United States, and we eventually settled in Wichita, KS.</p>

                <p className="" style={styles.p}> After completing high school, I relocated to Dallas, TX with the aim of pursuing a career in the medical industry. During my time in Dallas, I developed a passion for technology and made a decision to obtain the Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Information Technology, seeking to enhance my expertise and broaden my personal and professional horizons. </p>

                <p className="" style={styles.p}> In 2020, amidst the escalating Covid-19 pandemic, my employer presented me with an opportunity that led me to Seattle, where I currently reside and work. </p>

                <p className="" style={styles.p}> Outside of my professional pursuits, I find great joy in exploring different parts of the world, immersing myself in diverse cultures as a passionate traveler. Additionally, I indulge in my love for snowboarding and occasionally challenge myself with skydiving.</p>

                <p className="" style={styles.p}>Motivated by the desire to expand my knowledge in Tech Industry and advance my career prospects, I made the decision to join the Full Stack Application Development Bootcamp. This immersive experience has been both exhilarating, demanding and rewarding. I am very excited to see where this new path will take me. </p>
