                <p>My story starts in a small southwestern town in the former Soviet Union. At a young age, my family immigrated to the United States and settled in Wichita, KS.</p>
            
            
                <p>After graduating high school, I moved to Dallas, TX to pursue my career in the medical plasma field. While in Dallas, I studied Information Technology at Phoenix University to further progress in my field and to develop my professional knowledge.</p>
            
            
                <p>In 2020, just as Covid19 was ramping up, my current employer brought me to Seattle where I now reside and work. </p>
            

            
                <p>When time allows, I am a very passionate world traveler, an avid snowboarder, and occasionally a timid skydiver.</p>
            
            
                <p>I joined the Full Stack Application Development Bootcamp to advance my knowledge and career beyond what it is now, and so far, it has been an absolute blast and a great challenge. At the end of the bootcamp, newly gained skills will go towards transitioning out of a medical field-type career and towards something new and more interesting, as well as more flexible where I will be able to work and travel more freely. </p>
