## Project Description
The scope of the project is to create a portfolio using newly learned React skills, which will help set me to set myself apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.

### User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications 
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples 
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer:

- WHEN I load the portfolio, THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.
- WHEN I view the header, THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
- WHEN I view the navigation titles, THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
- WHEN I click on a navigation title, THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted. 
- WHEN I load the portfolio the first time, THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default. 
- WHEN I am presented with the About Me section, THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.
- WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section, THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.
- WHEN I am presented with the Contact section, THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
- WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, THEN I receive a notification that this field is required. 
- WHEN I enter text into the email address field, THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address.
- WHEN I am presented with the Resume section, THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
- WHEN I view the footer, THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)

## Additional Requirements

- An image of the deployed application (either a short animated GIF or screenshot)
